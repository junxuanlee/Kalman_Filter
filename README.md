# Kalman_Filters
This repository shows the implementations of Kalman filter on:

i) Static Autoregressive (AR) Signal

ii) Dynamic Autoregressive (AR) Signal

Implementation i) showed linear state estimation and implementation ii) showed non-linear state estimation. The results from both implementations showed that Kalman Filter performed better in i) than that in ii). This verified the Kalman Filter's property as linear state estimator and it should not be used in non-linear state estimation.
